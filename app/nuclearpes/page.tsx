                                        The IEEE PES SBC SCTCE hosted a Rust Workshop as part of the Advent College Technical Fest 2023. The workshop aimed to introduce participants to Rust, a modern programming language known for its safety and performance features, and to explore its applications in the realms of Arduino programming and various power and energy sectors. The workshop was expertly conducted by Mr. Gokul P S, a professional with over three years of hands-on experience in working with Rust. His extensive knowledge and practical expertise in Rust programming brought valuable insights to the workshop.

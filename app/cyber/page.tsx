                                        The WIE AG IEEE SCT SB conducted a webinar on ‘Cyber Safety and Smart Social Networking’. Online safety is trying to be safe on the internet and is the act of maximizing a user's awareness of personal safety of private information associated with using the internet, and the self-protection from computer crime. Since this is growing to be a concern, the WIE AG IEEE SCT SB organized this webinar. The talk was given by Mr. Milivoje Batista, founder of Atrom G8, who had previously been involved in various cyber security firms. It was a very interactive session.
